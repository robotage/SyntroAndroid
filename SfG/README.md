# Syntro for Glass

SfG is an experimental Glass app that acts as both a SyntroNet camera and also a viewer of SyntroNet video and audio feeds.

### Build

This is designed to work with Android level 19 and Glass XE17. The project should be imported into the latest ADT and downloaded to Glass in the normal way.

### Running

The app can be started by saying "ok glass" followed by "syntro for glass". Or, start the app using the touchpad. The app creates two livecards. The default on displayed is the camera preview feed. This appears within SyntroNet as "Glass". Swiping forward takes you to the viewer screen. Tap on it to being up the menu cards. The first one allows you to stop SfG. Swipe backwards to scroll through the available feeds then tap on one to select it. This feed should then be displayed. To go back to the camera preview, swipe backwards.

Tapping on the touchpad when either of the SfG live cards is displayed gives you the option of stopping SfG. Since SfG keeps the display on all of the time, it's important to to do this or else bad things will happen eventually!
